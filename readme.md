# StreamBridge: Emby to Stremio

**StreamBridge** is an unofficial Stremio addon that lets you stream content from your personal or shared Emby server using IMDb or TMDb IDs. It works as a **stream resolver**: when you browse titles in Stremio using catalog addons like **Cinemeta** (or any other metadata addon), StreamBridge checks if the clicked movie or episode exists in your Emby library and, if found, returns a direct play link to stream it instantly from the emby server.

### Library browsing improvements

- Multiple Stremio catalogs are generated per Emby library, including dedicated "Last Added" and "Favorites" views.
- Catalog extras now support `sort=lastAdded`, `skip`, and `limit`, with larger page sizes (500 items by default).
- The addon synthesizes Emby-only metadata so home videos and unmatched series are still browseable with episode listings.
- Clicking those items now shows Emby-provided details inside Stremio instead of the "No information found" placeholder.
## ⚠️ Requirements

- **HTTPS Required**: Your Emby server must be accessible via HTTPS. HTTP and localhost addresses are not supported.
- **Public Access**: The Emby server must be accessible from the internet (not just localhost).

## ❓ FAQ

### Getting "Load failure" or authentication errors?

**Common causes and solutions:**

1. **Using HTTP instead of HTTPS**
   - ❌ `http://your-server.com:8096` 
   - ✅ `https://your-server.com:8096`
   - **Why?** Modern browsers and Stremio require secure connections for security. HTTP connections are blocked by default.   

2. **Using Emby Connect credentials instead of server credentials**
   - ❌ Your Emby Connect email/password
   - ✅ Your Emby server username/password (the ones you use to log into your Emby web interface)
   - **Where to get them?** Go to your Emby server web interface → Users → Your username → Edit → Set a password if you haven't already
   - **Note:** These are the same credentials you use when logging into your Emby server directly in a browser

3. **Using localhost addresses**
   - ❌ `localhost:8096` or `127.0.0.1:8096`
   - ✅ Your public HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://your-domain.com:8096`)
   - **Why?** The addon runs on the internet and needs to reach your server from outside your network

4. **Server not accessible from internet**
   - Make sure your Emby server is accessible via HTTPS from outside your local network
   - **Setup needed:** Configure your router/firewall to forward HTTPS traffic to your Emby server
   - **Alternative:** Use a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy) or VPN solution to expose your server securely
